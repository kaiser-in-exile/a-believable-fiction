				<p>
					A Believable fiction is a rather ambitious, and attempting
					to be eloquent blog written by a somewhat fictional
					character in an attempt to make sense of a strange world
					that the character inhabits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world of our character is indeed a strange one. A
					reality that exists not far from our own, but a piece of
					fiction still. With many differences, yet intriguing
					similarities. An alice in wonderland world, but with more to
					wonder at than just land. Filled with personalities,
					opinions, strange looms that weave magic on button clicks,
					and stranger entities that make words and thought out of
					sparks in stone.
				</p>
				<p>
					In all seriousness there is no specific rhyme or reason to
					any post on the page, anything fanciful or mundane might be
					written, edited, and just as well removed as needed, but at
					least something will be there.
