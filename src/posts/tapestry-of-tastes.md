# A Tapestry of Tastes

A(n opinionated) deep dive into why certain content vibes, sometimes objectively, better than others

## Surveyed Samples

-   Suits

A small time talented drug dealer sidekick discovers his photographic memory grants him a natural talent for law, through a chance interview nonetheless, and teams up with an equally charismatic mentor navigating the labyrinthine leeways of New York law firms.

-   For All Mankind

In an alternate history where the Soviet Union wins the race to the moon, The United States does all it can, to not be left picking up the scraps and leftovers. Follows through on the massive engineering challenges, amidst a backdrop of immense political and personal ramifications on earth and even beyond for all involved.

-   Dexter

Miami has a new criminal mastermind, actively at work within the metropolitan police department. Follow dexter as he looks to sate his lust for blood but never through means which would breaak his self imposed code of righteousness

## Common Core

A common theme in all three is of sophistication. The more elaborate the better, there's an undercurrent of complexity to law, engineering, and murder. These shows present them at the crossroads of arts and science, where creativity lashes, and twists, and turns against the bounds imposed by the physical world. Sometimes upending the world itself in the process.

### Excellencies

At their core, they are also stories of incredible feats by incredible people, engineering to reach the moon is no small feat, nor is excelling at law a trivial tale, and there are very few successful mass murderers. Each of these disciplines takes practiced and very human excellence to achieve, and is no small feat.

The individual achievements here are also more impressive when set against the backdrop of the recurring conflicts. In Dexter, the conflict of being caught, and maintaining a secretive double lifestyle. The law of suits being a minefield of conflicts of all nature, not to mention personal lives, and in for all mankind the protagonists quite literally struggle against the very universe as it confines them to the earth. All these conflicts highlight the immense skill, and challenge required, and present to the viewer, a position to be aspired for, at least in terms of the skill required here. The ingenuity, skill and creativity of the struggle are remarkable.

### Deficiencies

All these shows start to age rather poorly, as the characters and stories develop the personal lives and motivations start bubbling to the surface, becoming more and more prominent to the plot until they have replaced the plot itself. The very essence of the program is lost, what drew people in the first place, what creates an excitement and the reason why you would want to watch, a part that draws a moth to the flame is gone, disappeared in the mire on interpersonal relationships which are now of greater importance to be resolved and nit the problem at heart.

That there is the ultimate failing of these shows, the importance of relationships over elements of plot.
