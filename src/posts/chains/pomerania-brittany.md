# Name Twins

Much like [Lviv and Singapore](/posts/chains/lviv-singapore), and apparently, Lviv and Hyderabad, and Singapore. There are several places which share the same name in spirit. Early humans, and later humans, enamoured in some cases by lions and on other occasions by the timeless endless sea, saw these places and miles apart were reminded of the same thing.

An interesting case of name twins, this time not cities, but places. Both having tumultous histories, is that of Pomerania, now divided between Germany and Poland and of Brittany, a jutting peninsula from mainland France. While very different on the surface. They share an ancient name.

## Pomerania

The region that is called Pomerania, is located between modern day Poland and Germany, split by the Oder river estuary, this land was once populated by Slavs, (like much of East Germany) who gave the region it's initial name. Perhaps inspired by it's seaside nature, and beautiful coast, they called this region Po-Mor-Jane.

As the eagle eyed ones, who might have spotted between the lines, and uncovered names through history might have already spotted the connection, but now let's take a whirlwind onto the edge of Frankia.

## Brittany

On the north western edge of France, is a Peninsula, which quite unlike the landmass it is Attached to, for one, the geographic origins of this land, are shared with the scottish highlands, and an ocean apart with the eerie peaks of Appalachia, in North America, all formed simultaneously, and later distributed across the Atlantic as the Atlantic Ocean fissure itself into existence.

On it's human footprint too, Brittany is much unlike it's much larger state. Much of the land was Celtic, and in the chaos that ensued in Britain post the Adventus Saxonum (coming of the Saxons) more Celts would flee to Brittany to escape the Saxon tide. This is reflected in the place names in Brittany, such as [Cornouaille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornouaille). And in the name of the peninsula itself, Brittany for the Britons who dwell there.

### Before it was Brittany...

... It was Armorica, a peninsula on the Western edge of Gallia, or Gaul. Dominated by Celts, and in the days of Rome ruled from Lugdugnum (modern day Lyon). But as the might of Rome faded, celtic culture resurfaced, and old contacts across the Bay of Biscay resurfaced. Celts were a culture based off of the Atlantic, with presence as far as Leon, in Spain, and of course, Britain in the North.

It is from these Celts, that Romans will borrow their name for this peninsula, Armorica.

## By the Sea

Both Pomorjane, and Armorica, share the same Mor in the middle of their name, both meaning the same thing, referring to the sea. Po-Mor-Jane, by the Sea, and Ar-Mori-Ca, in front of the sea. Two very different cultures, but a similar relationship to the sea.
