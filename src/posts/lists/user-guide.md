_Your guide to not messing things up when you interact with me_

## Boundaries

-   Do not assume that life outside our immediate conversation is a party to the conversation unless I bring it up, I prefer things to be oil and water, not milk.
-   Do not touch unless explicitly asked, or incapacitated, not at all.
-   Do not misquote me, I likely do not care about you, as much as I certainly care about what I say.
-   Do not make light of someone for trying or putting in an effort. If you think they are doomed, go help them.
-   Do not assume any degree of trust between us when conversing, trust is built not assumed.

## Baseline

-   Take ownership of what you say, and when you fail to deliver on that, just acknowledge. Skirting responsibility is a horrendous look.
-   Take effort seriously, it is respectable to try, even if the effort fails.
-   Have the common courtesy, to not present to people slop content, nor use slop to mask your intent.
-   Notice things, Observe your surroundings, there will be more cues than you can imagine.
-   If I am being bristly, it is a _very_ clear indication, I do not want to talk. So disengage, before you hear something regrettable.

## Appreciated

-   You can take the care to notice the finer details of interactions, and gleaming intent and reading the goddamn room. It's surprising how few people can capably do that.
-   Be appreciative of the little things that people around you do, notice and compliment them.
-   Be objective in assessment of things, stick to facts, and draw logical conclusions from those facts. There are few things more engaging than a well articulated train of thought.
