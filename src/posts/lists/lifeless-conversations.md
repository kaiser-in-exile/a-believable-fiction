# Lifeless Conversations

Lifeless conversations is a list of interesting, sometimes insightful oftentimes rude conversations to be had with everybody's favourite AI Assistant. [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/). The conversations here are _hopefully_ all public. If not please contact the author. :wink: :wink:, :nudge: :nudge:

Along with every post, I will endeavour to provide some ideas on how I would've wished to continue the conversations for future reference

# The List

-   A somewhat [deep dive into how window management works](https://chatgpt.com/c/68cae629-3c24-8332-9a83-7829a8e41ba0), how Windows' Approach has been very different from the one taken by apple for the same, and the consequences on that, all beginning from a conversation on display scaling.

    -   ...How does windowing work on Linux, is it different between different window managers
    -   ...What are some interesting quirks on windows and macOS, where their design choices produce rather amusing results

-   An analysis of a [hypothetical tax policy](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e10267-cc74-8013-b0dc-3d123d702a9d) diving into behavioural and social implications of such a policy.

    -   ...Attempt to critique and rectify moral hazards present in such a policy

-   [Fully Automated Luxury Communism](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e103e4-cfe8-8013-826e-a78cfab2a91d). I don't have further words for this.

    -   Automate it further I guess

-   A very [incorrect look](https://chatgpt.com/c/fa9438e9-650f-4023-b501-b81a5408cd1e) at india's founding mythos.

    -   ...Drive the conversation to a more nuanced view of Indian history and the origin of it's peoples

-   Attempting to create an [Etruscan inspired language](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e10469-8718-8013-8a2a-85ede16f53e1).
    -   ...Carry on further, see how much you can diverge this from Indo-European grammar, make it more etruscan like.

# Thanks
