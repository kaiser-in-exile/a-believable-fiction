# Lifeless Conversations

Lifeless conversations is a list of interesting, sometimes insightful oftentimes rude conversations to be had with everybody's favourite AI Assistant. [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/). The conversations here are _hopefully_ all public. If not please contact the author. :wink: :wink:, :nudge: :nudge:

Along with every post, I will endeavour to provide some ideas on how I would've wished to continue the conversations for future reference

# The List

-   Somewhat of a [deep dive into how window management works](https://chatgpt.com/share/68cae931-80ac-8013-a820-27388993f8bf), how Windows' Approach has been very different from the one taken by apple for the same, and the consequences on that, all beginning from a conversation on display scaling.

-   An analysis of a [hypothetical tax policy](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e10267-cc74-8013-b0dc-3d123d702a9d) diving into behavioural and social implications of such a policy.

-   Whatever [fully automated luxury communism](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e103e4-cfe8-8013-826e-a78cfab2a91d) is supposed to mean. I don't have further words for this.

-   Creating a distinctly non Indo-European [etruscan inspired language](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e10469-8718-8013-8a2a-85ede16f53e1).

-   A quick check about [describing conic sections](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f33cd0-1988-8013-85a2-f97ca8e22a97), in terms of cone half angles, and plane inclinations. Honestly half this mathematics is beyond me.
