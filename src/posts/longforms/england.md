title: An Outsiders Look at the History of Britain

_This is in large part inspired from my reading of Bernard Cornwell's [Saxon Stories](https://www.bernardcornwell.net/series/the-last-kingdom-series/) which is a fantastic book series_

Looking at the fascinating subject of British history, strictly an outsiders perspective

## The Geography of Britain

Located today in some of the northernmost reaches of europe, dividing the atlantic into a stormy sea and a calmer ocean, Britain is a rather large soil covered rock sitting in between the Atlantic and the North Sea right to the North of [Frankia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia). It is geographically quite a unique place. The [gulf stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream) a strong north atlantic current means that despite being on the same latitude line as Moscow, (and other harsh frigid wastes of Canada and Russia) London's weather is a great deal soggier, than either. A condition that lends itself fantastically to the development of agriculture, and the emergence of civilisation.

## The Peopling of Britain

The peopling of Britain with modern humans, especially with anatomically modern humans, and more so with societies which would be recognisable to us, is typically placed towards the end of the latest ice age (thw one which we are technically still currently in). ~10,000 years ago, since then Britain has been near continously occupied. A thing to note however is that earlier, much much earlier than that there were other hominids, species of humans who are not anatomically modern humans, who occupied this piece of land, which for an early part of it's history was not an island.

### Doggerland

For a part of it's history, the North Sea, was not a sea and instead a great northern plain at the very north of Europe, during the great cold ice ages, when massive portions of the the planet's water was trapped in massive ice sheets, the north sea would reveal itself to be shallow, and from it would emerge a land we now called doggerland. Stretching from what is now Denmark to England, both of them being rather hilly regions at the end of this plain, Doggerland would have been a rather lush tundra, there is a wealth of archaeological evidence for human habitation in doggerland, spear tips, arrows, marked anima skulls, all instruments of waging war against megafauna. Doggerland in some sense connected the people of what was to be Britain with the broader European landspace. Doggerland would - as the glaciers receded - disappear under the waters of the North Sea, until about ~5000BCE when Doggerland finally disappears forever severing off Britain from the rest of Europe; and what follows culturally is a remarkable process of connection.

## New Stone

Neolithic people are supposed to have come to Britain from two primary routes, one from a familiar to us route, which will later be used by other people of legends, through what is now Germany, Netherlands, and another through what is today spain. But they both came from the same place in the near east, bringing along with them the crops of their home. The dry weather loving barley, and wheat.

With their new stone, and even more revolutionary technology of agriculture, these new people, would soon replace the pre-existing societies of Britain, the hunter gatherers, either being assimilated, or wiped out by the sheer majority of the neolithic farmers

Aegean ancestry - replacement of hunter gatherers - what kind of crops? - what kind of animals - artifacts? - culrue and religion
