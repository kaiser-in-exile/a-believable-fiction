_This is in large part inspired from my reading of Bernard Cornwell's [Saxon Stories](https://www.bernardcornwell.net/series/the-last-kingdom-series/) which is a fantastic book series_

# Where is Britain

## The Geography of Britain

Often synonymised with the [North Atlantic garbage patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_garbage_patch) (which is another unrelated human construct), Britain is a rather large soil covered rock sitting in between the Atlantic and the North Sea right to the North of [Frankia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia). It is geographically quite a unique place. The [gulf stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream) a strong north atlantic current means that despite being on the same latitude line as Moscow, (and other harsh frigid wastes of Canada and Russia) London's weather is a great deal soggier, than either. A condition that lends itself fantastically to the development of  agriculture, and the emergence of civilisation.

# The Peopling of Britain

The earliest human remains on Britain are approximately 800,000 years old, that's a mind bogglingly old number. In those days, Britain was not island connected to mainland Europe by a piece of land called doggerland, in what is now the North Sea. These old people, were no doubt hunter gatherers, armed with a very limited arsenal of stone tools, these people took it upon themselves to lay the foundations of human society.
