# Neither here, nor there

- I met one of my college friends after a long long time, over indie-web no less.

- When returning from Indie Web, I decided to take the long route, walking about 4 and half kilometers with a reasonably weighty backpack is actually quite the disaster. Even with a Chai Point rescuing me half way.

- Visited Go Native, a fancy upscale place, and was not at all surprised at the bougey snobbishness of the endeavour. The only rescue, again being the presence of a Chai Point nearby. As an aside, Chai Point not calling their points program as "Chai Points" is a missed opportunity.

- Had a relaxed week at work, since most of the people I am supposed to work with are out, the rug of requirements has not been pulled in a while from under my feet.

- I have had to review a bunch more slop, honestly the scariest part of slop is how correct it looks, and how much scrutiny it takes to see where it falls apart. Fortunately I have found slop machine to be good at helping me isolate code flows so I can reason about them independently, and find bugs that way. But I slowly feel that craft competence is evaporating in software engineering.
