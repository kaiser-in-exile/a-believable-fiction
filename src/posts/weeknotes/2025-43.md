# Misery All Around

-   Happy _Halloween_, or _Samhain_, or Post Diwali, or whatever you keep. I personally believe celebrations should not be gatekept, and neither should accompanying treats sweetmeats and the like. Please share, care, and enjoy.

-   No new content for any blogposts yet. I seem to be stuck on concluding the Britain blog - II which will hopefully come out some day. If you have not yet, read the [first part here](/posts/longforms/england-i).

-   I have discovered the great skill of compartmentalisation, which has allowed me to silo into states of mind which don't mutually interfere. I can thus be in multiple projects in relatively isolated contexts. Ensuring one does not impact the other.

> Ignorance perhaps is true bliss, and containserisation for sure the best technology ever invented.

-   I had a cool idea about a VSCode extension which I will try to implement. It is based around typing to bring a really cool feature from Victoria 3, a game I love, into VSCode. I hopefully will be able to see that through, at the very least eventually.

-   I picked up a new book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32276.The_Dragons_of_Eden">the Dragons of Eden</a> another one of Carl Sagan's phenomenal works. I now have a newfound respect for science communicators and those who empower the public's understanding of science.
