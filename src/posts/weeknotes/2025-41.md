# Hectic and Chaotic

-   Traffic was without a doubt _insane_ this week. Not just vehicle traffic even pedestrian traffic.
-   We had quite possibly the lamest office party till date. No vibes at all.
-   Diwali begins the next week, which means this is the weekend of Diwali cleaning. Lots of chores to do.
-   Misery certainly seems to like company as my flatmates are both down with cold and sniffles, I am thus far blissfully unaffected and very earnestly hoping that that continues
-   One of my flatmates returned from quite the adventure of a lifetime from a Thailand Trip. I have quite earnestly listened to the tales therefrom, and that has only served to solidify my belief that South East Asia is not for the peace and quiet lover in me. Although should that change, I am very open to the idea.
