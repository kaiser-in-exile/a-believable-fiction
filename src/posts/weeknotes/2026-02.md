# A Return to Normal

- I have finally returned to Bengaluru, after my little trip across Uttar Pradesh. As [stated earlier](/posts/longforms/hot-takes-2025.md), I believe Varanasi to be the sole and singular highlight of the journey, with the rest of UP only a reminder of how much needs to be done in India.

- I seem to be recovering from my rather unfortunate bout of sickness, occasional nausea still takes me over sometimes, but it is infinitely better now. I have been prescribed antibiotics and anti inflammatory medicine, so hopefully like any other infection this too is a transitory phenomenon.

- Claude Opus (in combination with cursor) has very finally delivered on what was long touted as the future of software development, the code is finally up to a quality that is production satisfactory. Unfortunately, that means for those who are unfamiliar, shipping correct looking slop has become easier, making my job as a reviewer painful.

- I have discovered, or rather I must phrase, adopted an old routine as my own to avoid the traffic, an 8-3 in Bangalore (yes, it is a perfectly acceptable alternative spelling) makes infinitely more sense considering the traffic at most hours, and the lack of thereof on the commute hours on this schedule.

- Happy new year 2026!
