# Happy Diwali

-   It is Diwali week, which means most of this country heads home to celebrate the festival with their families. It is especially evident in cities like Bengaluru, where I currently reside. Drained if it's usual bustle, city calm is actually quite pleasant.

-   Had an amazing start to the week when I visited an Andhra restaurant near our place. Possibly some of the best _Paneer_ gravies I have had in Bangalore.

-   Managed to get my hands on some sparkles and have a small diwali celebration right up on the terrace of where we stay.

-   Excitingly enough, this also marks the first time I will be using an image on this website, so I had some styles to adjust.
