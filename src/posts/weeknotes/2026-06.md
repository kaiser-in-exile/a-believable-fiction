# Miasma, all manners of Miasma

- I am seeing more slop, and am now being called out for calling out slop, apparently shipping slop and slopdumping on reviewers is acceptable as work etiquette in Software Engineering now. By the gods, I am starting to despise this field. Anything borne out of laziness cannot result in good outcomes, is apparently a trivial yet stubbornly elusive grain of truth, especially to those who need it the most.
- I have picked up a new book. <sup>yay!</sup> [Oxygen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/291056.Oxygen) another fantastic read.
- I have come to the realisation, Air India Express, despite it's association with the laggardly branding of Air India, is actually a pretty good airline.
- My Poor Doggo has developed quite the cough, unfortunate weather change is - I am told - to blame for his malaise. I cannot help but sympathise, havng been the victim of a cruel cough not long ago.
- I recently finished watching the first season of [Sense8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2431438/), which was quite the refresh. It's been a while since we stepped into wacky and clasically cool adventure stories. That in addition to the charm of [Poker Face](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14269590/) has meant media has stayed entertaining.
- I completed a campaign of [Victoria 3](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/victoria-3/about) as a reformist Indian state. It is very telling how much reform and education can change a country, but only against the security backdrop provided by the East India Company.
