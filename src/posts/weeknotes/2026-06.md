# Homecoming

- I am back home again, in what seems like no time at all. Chores as usual promise to keep me busy, but my pet dog does all he can to distract, and tries his best to be a nuisance, which I can appreciate.
- A new pack of strays has moved into our vicinity. My dog and I got into a fight with them as expected. The municipal corporation is toothless as ever in removing those.
- I binged Season 2 of Sense8, it is again a really nice story, although a bit graphic and intense in some aspects. I do however appreciate one standout, is how much Sense8 often feels like a DnD Game, where the party has to rely on everyone's specific skills to get out of a sticky situation. I suppose that moment of realisation, is probably my highlight of the show.
- I have authored a post on the nature of Engineering, and why it brings me joy. You can read it [here](/posts/longforms/fun-of-engineering).
- I also added the IndieWebClub webring to this website. If correctly done, which I hope. It should be visible in the footer.
- While I missed Indie Web Club events due to my absence from Bangalore, I have still taken the opportunity to be inspired with the given prompts on my blog on the joy of engineering.
