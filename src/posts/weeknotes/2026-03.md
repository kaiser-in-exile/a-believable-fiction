# Recovery

- My physical health seems to be recovering. 🤞🏾, I pray the upswing continues

- A long weekend approaches with a great opportunity for rest and relaxation. No doubt to be interrupted often enough by the oddities of banality.

- It's been a busy week at work, we are hosting visitors from a separate office, with hosting come good puns on the topic <span lang="hi">मिस्सी रोटी</span> and great lunches and an opportunity for conversation.

- I am astounded by the level of AI psychosis at my firm, inspite of repeated disasters, the delusional optimism would be hilarious were it not happening so close to me in person.

- On the topic of AI, I have had several meaningless conversations on AI Coding at this point. It seems we are back into hype cycle mode, but this time with muted expectations.

- I have started reading [Proto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217387741-proto) which is also a fascinating story of the Proto Indo European, and their daughter and sister cultures.

- The unending content mine that is the United States, continues to deliver, with TACOs on Greenland and toughness on Iran returning. Trump is indeed quite the statement of confidence on my gold bonds, although at a catastrophic global excess.
