# Recovery

- My physical health seems to be recovering. 🤞🏾, I pray the upswing continues

- A long weekend approaches with a great opportunity for rest and relaxation. No doubt to be interrupted often enough by the oddities of banality.

- It's been a busy week at work, we are hosting visitors from a separate office, with hosting come good puns on the topic <span lang="hi">मिस्सी रोटी</span> and great lunches and an opportunity for conversation.

- I am astounded by the level of AI psychosis at my firm, inspite of repeated disasters, the delusional optimism would be hilarious were it not happening so close to me in person.
