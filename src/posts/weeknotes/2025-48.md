# Hiatus

- Got thoroughly blasted with heinous cold. Bad enough to put me out of action for a week, hence the absence in weeknotes.

- Much like the strange merchant in [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net) (Which is, by all accounts, a beuatiful game), LitFest is in town in Bangalore, I do intend to attend.

- Work is amongst the many things that has been adversely spellbound by coal, while my changed voice earned the usual ridicule, my throat has made me slave to hot tea and hot water.

- Tea is conclusively the greatest invest to come out of China, in hindsight, and armed with newfound appreciation for tea, I see the rationalism in the enterprise of the Opium Wars.

- I finished [Power, Sex and Suicide by Nick Lane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39001.Power_Sex_Suicide). Which is a really interesting read. Especially when bedridden and sufferring high fever, the insight while not curative in any sense, made me appreciate the fever and it's causative mechanism more.

- It seems flights in India are affected by strongarming of some nature, as a holder of a flight ticket, I am somewhat skeptical, but optimistic.
